Yesterday and Today we worked on Postgres and SQL with our kilovolt blogs. I had
Chris as me PP and we got it finished with little difficulty.

I am going to a meetup tonight hosted by Adobe as my first meetup, and for my assignment.
I am looking forward to seeing what can be done with Adobe products in UI/UX design and
development.
