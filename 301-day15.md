We were given our teams for the final project and I am pretty stoked about our final project. It will be an app that helps veterans that may be struggling to find care facilities and approximate estimation on wait times based on the specific location for issues like PTSD(post traumatic stress disorder), TBI (traumatic brain injuries), MST (military sexual trauma), and suicide prevention. There is so much information out there on the VA site but it is very difficult to navigate and is buried in a lot of links and external sources that it can be confusing for a vet that is in dire need of help. Hopefully this site will make it a little easier for a vet to get the help they deserve.
