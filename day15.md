After a shaky first go with out project week team, Katherine H. was pretty set on doing her
show tracker project idea, but without the use of API's to pull show information we would be just
inserting fluff (in my opinion) and not really using our full potential to showcase our skill level.
I just wanted a second opinion from Sam and she seemed really defensive in my suggesting of that, saying
Sam had already said it fit the scope of 201. I proceeded to ask for it anyways. I stepped away for a break and
when I got back the TA's showed up at our table to see how we were and Zach and Katherine explained what she proposed
and how to dial it back to get it into scope and the TA's agreed that it would make the project way too simple for 4 people to adequately contribute to. I made my opinion known and pitched a new concept for a game that Zach and I had originally talked
about and Katherine begrudgingly accepted stating that I would complain if we didn't do a game. We started brainstorming the planning session and that we would meet and hash it out on Sunday. But then Katherine wanted our user stories submitted to her by 5 pm. I also forgot to mention that Gaby bailed on us at 3pm when her husband came to pick her up.  This is twice that has happened to me with Gaby.
I am slightly concerned because the rest of us have put in significant pre planning work for the pitch on Monday.

Sunday, Katherine and I were the only 2 to show up on time. Zach was late because he forgot to check slack and give confirmation on the meeting time so I texted him to come meet with us. He arrived an hour and a half late but was immediately began to contribute. For those looking at this a an experiment of an us vs them this is not the case, he felt bad for being late and jumped right in to help. Yes I am fully aware of being paired with one person I get along with well vs some those that have different experiences and may clash with my personality, and it seems you picked well with Katherine. She has dev and project lead experience, where as I have military and ran 3 tax offices being in charge of work flow, hiring, training, and my way of doing things and we clashed. When I was trying to explain that we have different managerial styles, she told me not to "man-splain her". I have not, nor ever will have a gender, racial, faith, or sexual orientation, bias. I was raised by my grandmother who was the strongest person I ever knew. My girlfriend is black, I have gay best friends, and I am an Atheist that respects others choice to follow a religion. To be directly accused of having a bias set me off. I get women have difficulties in advancing in web development, and I am going to be a champion for that cause and make sure they get the equal treatment wherever I land a job and voice my opinion openly to the public as well. Anyways, so I was a little upset and told her to never accuse me of that again. I was not invalidating her, her work, her opinions, but she took it upon herself to do extra work without really talking to the group and expecting the same level of output as her. I told her I needed a decompression day after 3 weeks of not having a single day for myself, and I have a different way of organizing and submitting my work for the group in a timely manner that it would be usable for the planning meeting. Maybe not for her timeline of user case documentation, but at this point in our web development, they are going to be very similar anyway. The team has not agreed that she is to be a PM, and to be honest I think we should all be equally responsible and share in the responsibility during the project and keep each other accountable for what wee say we are going to do and when.  She responded by saying Brandon specifically selected her for that very role for our group.  I do not know for sure if he did or did not but it was never stated to the group as such, and to be blunt, this is our group not Brandon's, or Sam's. We are doing the work and they are there for support to aid us if we get stuck and set us on the right path to finish the project.

I have dealt with conflict management and I am hoping to resolve this without needing TA or Sam intervention. That is how it works in the real world. That would be my first question to my employees if they cam e to me with a conflict. "Did you try to resolve it yourselves first?" I am a firm person in my ways, but I do know when to humility is needed. I am going to try really hard to get along with Katherine and we have seemed to make peace that we are different, I just hope it pans out for this week.
