Yesterday we learned about deploying through Heroku. While I am still leery about giving out my cc information but I am going to trust Scott and update my profile with the info to be able to complete my assignments.

My portfolio is still not to mvp but it is getting closer. I spent 4 hours last night going through the TODO's and I believe I should be almost there by this weekend if I can get a little help narrowing down what actual TODO's I need to get done.
