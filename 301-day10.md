Over the weekend I was trying to get my portfolio up to date and was looking through all the technical todo's and was having a hard time sorting through to figure out what would be redundant and what was essential and just got lost. I added the templates but for some reason it would not render to the DOM and just got frustrated and tried getting help from peers and they couldn't figure it out and we switched gears and decided to do the codewars instead.
