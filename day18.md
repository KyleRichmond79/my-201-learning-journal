We finally made MVP around 6:30pm of the 29th of June. It has been a rollercoaster ride of a week
but we made it through with great effort and contributions by everyone. I am really proud of our project
given the fact we put it together after scrapping our first idea.  I really enjoyed working with my team and learned
some valuable lessons.
