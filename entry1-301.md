Last night and today, I worked with Austin for our PP assignment.  We made a nice workflow plan
and executed. Austin drove on the html and I drove on the css.  My first hang-up came on when
starting the portfolio.  Bash decided it didn't want to work correctly and spent time trying to
get that sorted out. Brandon had to have me install git-cmd program so I could toggle between
different terminals. I was able to get skeleton and font awesome files added and then made my
project constructor in js and had to submit what I had and will need to go back tonight and
finish the rest of the assignment.
