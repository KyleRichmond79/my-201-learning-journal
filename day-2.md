git # Learning Journal: Day 2

Today I shredded all kinds of codez.

I am still having problems with navigating my terminal. I try to go directly to the different directory paths with out using 'CD' to change the directory, which in turn, causes me to not be able to keep up with Sam as he is showing his steps in lecture. It is a little frustrating but it is just going to take practice.

Getting an overview of the macro verse of HTML, CSS, and JS really helps me grasp the scope of webdev and that is pretty cool.
