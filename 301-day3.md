So I am finding myself falling behind. It has been rough adjusting to the split
lab hours and waiting for lecture in the afternoon. most of my lab time seems to
be taken up with the pair partnering and also struggling with getting a handle on
my css my portfolio is really behind. I am planning on working hard this weekend
to get back to where I should be but it is frustrating that I feel like I should
have a better grasp of what is going on. I had this similar issue in 201 where once
I saw a function or line of code written out I understood what was going on, but
I have a hard time writing it for myself. Which is why I am kinda glad to be working
with legacy code, because it gives me a least somewhat of a starting point, but I
struggled with Day 3 lab functionality especially the main nav targeting the read on
portion.
