So far this weekend I have learned that I am confused in css. I don't know why
I am struggling so much. When I try to apply positioning I move things that I
don't want to move and the element I want to move doesn't budge unless I just
start adjusting targeting top and giving a pixel value, when I go to test how it
moves if the browser display changes, it doesn't adjust properly.

Very frustrated where I am at currently. I know it takes a long time to get a
good control over css, but I feel I should be able to move elements in a basic
layout, but for some reason I am not there yet. (Not Yet language trying to be
reinforced.)

I appreciate and enjoy getting help from my peers but I feel I am just parroting
code and not creating on my own. When it comes time for final projects, I don't
want to be the one they are waiting on to finish my assigned task.
