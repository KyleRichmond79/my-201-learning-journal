Yesterday we were able to address some of our week 1 concerns and got some feedback and Scott asked for some time to work on possible solutions and is going to get back with us on them.

We learned AJAX and had some more with JSON in lecture yesterday. The pair partnering
assignment went easier this time because I think the material made more sense.

I had my 1 on 1 with Scott this morning and addressed some of my personal concerns.
I am going to grit this out, I understand I hit a wall and was pushed to my limit and I know
I am going to be pushed again, I need to utilize Scott as a resource when I am not getting the desired help from others that are needed.
