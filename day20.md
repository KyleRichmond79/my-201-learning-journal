We presented Click a Brady yesterday and it went well! We had no major breakdowns and the project
behaved as it was supposed to. I got to watch the rest of the 201 teams and their projects and I thought
everyone did really well. A group of us got together at Austin's last night and we celebrated our success
and we made a 301 pact, we will no longer just take a picture of each others codes and try to implement them in our own work,
rather we will ask them to show us on a whiteboard, paper and pencil, etc. on how to understand what they did
so we can code it out in our own assignments/projects and understand why we are doing it and putting the code where it belongs to make it work properly for us.  We all agree that was our core mistake and hampered, at least hampered my learning.

I genuinely care for that group, we have bonded well and we will continue to grow as our student career and Code Fellows continues through to graduation of 401. The ability to get through our first projects and understand each others triggers and expectations will allow our communication skills between each other to grow stronger.
