where to start? I feel lost, in my feedback for 301 week 1 I laid out all my
frustrations so it may have come across a little harsh. I know we are being pushed
far outside our comfort zones on purpose but I feel like I am not there yet. I understand
on a global level what is going on, I know the problem at hand in the assignment but
I get lost when I sit down to write the code. The docs have an example but I just
can't seem to connect the dots with the example to how it should be implemented.
I still need a reference point and the vagueness of the directions given does not
include that reference point. Maybe we were coddled a little bit in 201, but even then
I needed help from a peer to see where and how they started for my brain to get what
needed to be done. Sam told me in my 1 on 1 with him in 201 that I have a way of seeing
the end result and connected the dots faster than most people he has taught, but I
can't seem to dial that back to see the process it takes and that is where I am struggling.
I can't just sit down and write out a function to make the magic happen, and it is
greatly effecting my confidence level. I feel stupid when I know I am not. I have had more
roadblocks than Aha moments. I just don't know what I need  to do to change that at this point.
