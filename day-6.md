Today I worked on object literals and creating methods within an object. This was difficult in the
aspect of naming conventions. I would have a hard time determining which property name to use when
creating the method and getting it to execute properly. Then when a fellow classmate would show me what they did
I would mix up the property name they used with what I had named my property to add more confusion. I
eventually got it all sorted out and completed the assignment but the objective we were supposed to learn
has not stuck with me yet and I probably could not repeat the assignment without assistance.
